					<h2>ABOUT ME<h2>
				</div>
			<p><center>I am about to be a graduate of Armstrong High School and am looking forward to my studies at Butler Community College for Human Resource Management until I transfer to Penn State. I've lived in the beautifully forested Pennsylvania during my life but am looking forward to traveling and meeting different people. I was raised with a love for animals and the outdoors.This has fostered my hobbies such as hiking, playing tennis, riding my motorcycle and cooking.</p>

		</div>
			
			<p>Through my experiences in the past four years at Armstrong, I have developed the skills and assets to start me on the path to helping people. Upon graduation, I will be furthering my education and searching for an internship. I hope to join a organization where I will work hand in hand with the employees I would be evaluating. My greatest strengths involve communication, writing, development of teamwork, analyzing situations and influencing others. These are skillsets that I have aquired through my work in my community as well in traditional school settings.</p>
			<p>My highschool career was valuable, eye-opening, and paramount at developing who I am. Explore my ePortfolio to learn more about my experiences and interests!</center></p>
