				<p><center>Newspaper is the most salient activity to me as I have been in it since 2012. As a twelve year old in seventh grade, I started out as a comic artist and there were only five members in the entire club. I was shy and had an inconsequential writing ability. Only a year later, as it was junior high, I was voted editor and loved assigning, as well as writing, articles. I planned the issues and ran the meetings, teachers would compliment my work and I was told the next year I would be placed in a gifted English class. In high school, I prided myself on literature, writing and helping as the only freshman on the staff. After the combination of Ford City and Kittanning, I remained leader and our numbers grew. I found the task invigorating, although slightly disheartening when I saw no one could care about the club as much as me.  Throughout the years, I have learned to open up to new tasks and leadership roles, as writing has made me the person I am today; the person who can stand in front of a crowd and give an impromptu speech, write an eight page report for fun, talk to their future college, already, to start a university newspaper, and the person who can write this with a smile on her face knowing she grew a club to be the best it could be while it did the same to her.

				<h3>Union Lockout</h3>

				<p><center>For almost two years my father was involved with illegal business practices. By that, I mean, the company my dad worked at held an illegal lockout where hundreds of families were hurt in the aftermath. For the majority of my seventeen year lifespan the caregiver of my family worked at ATI, (Allegheny Technologies Industries) where he fixed the machines in sweltering work conditions. He worked such odd shift hours that I would go weeks without seeing him, he would only be home sleeping when I was at school. Suddenly, I saw my dad constantly, he was locked out of work while USW, his union, tried to organize a contract with fair pay, conditions and breaks. At first, it was splendid; my dad was catching up on maintenance around the house and the bags under his eyes were diminishing with the correct amount of sleep. However, when the lockout and picketing continued, for nine months, his eyes grew more tired than they were before. My family was struggling financially. The community was providing us with food but we had to fit in our doctor's visits fast before our insurance ran out and I wasnâ€™t entirely sure my parents would be able to co-sign on college loans for me. The day my dad went back to work was a blessing. It was also the day I decided I want to go to college so I can get a degree in Labor and Industrial Relations, leading to a job where I can make sure no family is illegally locked out of work again.</center></p>

				<h3>Business Writing</h3>

				<p><center>In my pursuit to one day receive a degree in Labor and Industrial Relations, I decided it is never to early to practice. Upon being admitted to have an independent study, granted only to students who have taken all classes available for a certain subject and thus they decide their own curriculum, for writing class during my senior year I used my time to create business writings. This one is for a break increase from the perspective of United Steel Workers to Allegheny Technologies Industry.</center></p>
